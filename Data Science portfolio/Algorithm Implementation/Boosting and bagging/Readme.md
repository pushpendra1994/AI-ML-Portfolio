In this Particular Case study I have  tried various boosting and bagging based algorithm to classify red wine quality <br>

Data set used in this case study have 1500 rows and 12 columns  <br>
target columns tells about quality of wine <br>
This Data set contains the information related red wine , Various factors affecting the quality. This data set was prepossessed and downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning <br> Repository. This data set was simple, cleaned, practice data set for classification modelling. Source of this Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality <br>

Attribute Information: <br>
Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): <br>
1 - fixed acidity <br>
2 - volatile acidity <br>
3 - citric acid <br>
4 - residual sugar <br>
5 - chlorides <br>
6 - free sulfur dioxide <br>
7 - total sulfur dioxide <br>
8 - density <br>
9 - pH <br>
10 - sulphates <br>
11 - alcohol <br>
Output variable (based on sensory data):
12 - quality ('good' and 'bad' based on score >5 and <5)


**Steps followed:-**


1.   Importing Various Library <br>
2.   Loading Dataset 

1.   Basic Sanity Check
2.   Exploratory Data Analysis

1.   Splitting Dataset/ preprocessing data 
2.   Build Ensemble based model and hypertuning

1.   Build Boosting Based Algorithms hypertuning
2.   Evaluation of models on various aspect like
